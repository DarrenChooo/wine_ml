# Wine Quality Data Prediction Algorithm
This project aims to analyse and build a model from the dataset of Wines to learn about prediction algorithm. The analysis includes 
visualising the distribution and correlations of alcohol, sulphates, citric acid, and other key metrics. The notebook 
provides various visulisations to help understand the patterns and relations in the data.
